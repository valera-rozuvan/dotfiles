# dotfiles

Various dotfiles for apps & services I use. Use at your own risk. Highly specific for my own needs.

## Setup

To install just Bash* stuff, a handy script is provided. Please take a look at the script before you run it!

```
git clone https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Warning! The script `install.sh` wipes your old Bash* stuff.
./install.sh
```
