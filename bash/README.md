# Bash

Configs for bash and various session things.

## Setup

To install just Bash* stuff, a handy script is provided. Please take a look at the script before you run it!

```
git clone https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles/bash

# Warning! The script `install.sh` wipes your old Bash* stuff.
./install.sh
```
