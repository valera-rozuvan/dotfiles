# Emacs

Over the last 10 or so years, I have tried Emacs couple of times. I still have it installed, and use it. I have three different config projects for Emacs, each one in a bit different style than the previous one. I guess this is due to the fact that my usage style of Emacs has changed over the years.

1. [emacs-config](./emacs-config)
2. [dotfiles-emacs](./dotfiles-emacs)
3. [orome-emacs](./orome-emacs)
